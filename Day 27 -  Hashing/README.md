#### 1. Triplets in GP

You are given an array and you need to count the number of triplets with indices (i, j, k) such that element at these indices are in GP for given common ratio 'r' and (i < j < k).

sample input :

N = 6

r = 4

arr [] = [1, 16, 4, 16, 64, 16]

sample output: 3

Explanation :
(1, 4, 16)
(1, 4, 16)
(4, 16, 64)

#### 2. Count Rectangles

Given N cartesian points in a 2D plane, find the number of axis parallel rectangles that can be formed.

sample input:

N = 8

Points [ ][ ] = [ [0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0], [2, 1], [2, 0], [3, 1], [3, 0] ]

sample output: 6

#### 3. Count Triangles

Given N cartesian points in a 2D plane, find the number of right angle triangles such that base or perperdicular is parallel to X or Y axis.

sample input:

N = 5

Points [ ][ ] = [ [1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 2], [2, 3], [4, 2] ]

sample output: 4

#### 4. Anagrams and Substring

Given a string, find the number of pairs of substring of string that are anagrams of each other.
Two strings are anagram of each other if the letters of one string can be rearranged to form the other string.

sample input:

S = abba

sample output: 4
