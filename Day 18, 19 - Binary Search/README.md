#### 1. Frequency Count

Given a sorted array which can contain repeated elements and an element K, we need to find the
the frequenct of a given element K.

sample input:

arr = [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 10] , k = 2

sample output: 3

#### 2. Min pair

Given two non-empty arrays, find the minimum absolute difference between any pair of
numbers (one from each array).

sample input:

n = 5, m = 6

arr1 = [-1, 5, 10, 20, 3]

arr2 = [26, 134, 135, 15, 17, 150]

sample output: 3 (between pair 20 and 17)

#### 6. Game of Greed

You are playing a game with your 'k' friends. You have an array of N coins, at each index i you have a coin of value a[i].
Your task is to divide the coins, among a group of K friends by doing consecutive segments (k-subarrays) of the array. Each friend will get a total sum of the coins in that subarray. Since all your friends are greedy, and they will pick the largest k- 1 segments and you will get the smallest segment.
Find out the maximum value you can make by making an optimal partition.

sample input:

n = 5, k = 3

coins = [1, 2, 3, 4]

sample output: 3

Explanation:

The ideal partition looks like this -

[1 + 2] = 3

[ 3 ] = 3

[ 4 ] = 4

Constraints =

1 <= N <= 10^6

1 <= K <= N

1 <= coins[i] <= 10^8
