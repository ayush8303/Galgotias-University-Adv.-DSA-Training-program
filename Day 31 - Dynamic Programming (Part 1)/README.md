#### 2. Min steps to reach one

You are given a positive integer 'N'. You have to reduce it to one by performing following steps.

(i). Reduce it to N-1. (N ==> N-1)

(ii). If it is divisble by 2, then divide it by 2. (N ==> N/2)

(iii). If it is divisble by 3, then divide it by 3. (N ==> N/3)

Input:

N = 16

Output: 3 (16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1)

#### 5. Ladder Problem

Given a ladder of size N, and an integer K, write a program to compute numbers
ways to climb the at level N if you can take a jump of atmost k at every step. Initially, you
are at level 0.

Input:

N = 1, k = 5

Output: 1

Input:

N = 0, k = 3

Output: 1

#### 6. Rod cutting

Given a rod of length N and array prices of length n denoting the cost of pieces of the rod of length 1 to N. find the maximum amount that can be made if the rod is cut up optimally.

Input:

N = 4

prices[] = [1, 1, 1, 6]

Output: 4
