## Prime Number

#### 1. Count Prime

Given an integer n, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than n.

Constraints : n <= 10^6

sample input:

n = 10

sample output: 4

Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.

#### 2. Prime sum

You are given a number n. Find all the pairs (l, r) such that l <= r and their sum is also prime and no more than n.

Note: l and r should be prime too.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5

Example:

Input: n= 5

Output: 1

Explanation:

In this case only pair (l, r) suits us - (2,3), because 2+3=5 , 5 is prime.
