## 2-D Dynamic Programming Problems

#### 1. Subset Sum Problem

Given a integer SUM and an array of non-negative integers. Determine if subset of array exists with sum equal SUM.

Constraints :

N <= 1000

SUM <= 1000

Sample input =

N = 5

SUM = 12

array [ ] = [2, 7, 4, 15, 19]

Sample output : 0

Sample input =

N = 5

SUM = 11

array [ ] = [2, 7, 4, 15, 19]

Sample output : 1 ({7,4})

#### 6. Paint House

There are a row of N houses, each can be painted with one of the three colors: RED,
GREEN, BlUE. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different.
You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represent by a 3 X N cost matrix.
For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color RED;
costs[1][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color GREEN and so on.
Find the minimum cost to paint all the houses.

Input:
N = 3

14 11 14

2 14 3

11 5 10

Output: 10 = 2 + 5 + 3
